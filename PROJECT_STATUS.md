# Project Status - Emerald Observatory Web

## Project Overview
We're creating a web-based version of the Emerald Observatory iOS app, which is an astronomical visualization tool. We've just completed the core sidereal time implementation in Phase 2 of the development.

## Current State

### 1. Project Structure
- React + TypeScript + Vite setup ✅
- Jest testing framework configured ✅
- Core dependencies installed (Three.js, Luxon, astronomy-engine) ✅

```

### 2. Implemented Features ✅
- TimeService with:
  - UTC time management ✅
  - Solar time calculations ✅
  - **Sidereal time calculations ✅** (NEW!)
  - Location awareness ✅
  - Subscription system for updates ✅
- React hook (useTime) for component integration ✅
- Comprehensive test suite ✅

### 3. Key Files ✅
- `src/services/TimeService.ts`: Complete time management service with all three time types
- `src/hooks/useTime.ts`: React hook for time service with sidereal time support
- `src/services/__tests__/TimeService.test.ts`: Complete test suite (11 tests passing)
- `jest.config.js` and `setupTests.ts`: Test configuration

### 4. Testing Setup ✅
All tests are now passing! The test suite includes:
- TimeService basic functionality tests
- Solar time calculation tests  
- **Sidereal time calculation tests ✅** (NEW!)
- Subscription and state management tests

Current Jest Configuration:
```javascript
{
  "preset": "ts-jest",
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/src/setupTests.ts"],
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$": "identity-obj-proxy",
    "\\.(gif|ttf|eot|svg|png)$": "<rootDir>/src/__mocks__/fileMock.ts"
  },
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.tsx?$": "ts-jest"
  }
}
```

## ✅ COMPLETED: Next Steps
1. ✅ Get the test suite running (COMPLETED - all 11 tests passing)
2. ✅ Implement Sidereal time calculations (COMPLETED - using astronomy-engine)
3. ⏭️ Move on to Location Service implementation

## Dependencies ✅
Key packages we're using:
- luxon: Time management ✅
  - Used for DateTime operations and timezone handling
  - Current implementation uses it for all time operations
- astronomy-engine: Astronomical calculations ✅
  - Currently using SunPosition and **SiderealTime functions ✅**
  - Used for accurate sidereal time calculations
- react + react-dom: UI framework ✅ (newly added)
- three.js: 3D visualizations (will be used later)
- jest/ts-jest: Testing ✅

## Current Status: PHASE 2 CORE SERVICES - SIDEREAL TIME ✅
**Status: COMPLETED**

### TimeService Implementation Details ✅
- **UTC Time**: Standard coordinated universal time ✅
- **Solar Time**: Local solar time based on sun position and longitude ✅  
- **Sidereal Time**: Star time using astronomy-engine's SiderealTime function ✅
  - Greenwich Sidereal Time (GST) calculation ✅
  - Local Sidereal Time (LST) with longitude correction ✅
  - Proper hour normalization (0-24 hours) ✅

### Testing Coverage ✅
- 11 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- TimeService basic operations (5 tests)
- Solar time calculations (3 tests) 
- **Sidereal time calculations (3 tests)** ✅
- All tests passing in Jest environment ✅

## Next Phase: Location Service Implementation
Ready to move to the next major component - implementing Location Service with:
- Enhanced geolocation integration
- Coordinate system calculations  
- Timezone handling improvements
- Integration with astronomical calculations

## Development Environment ✅
- Node.js environment ✅
- TypeScript for type safety ✅
- Vite for development server and building ✅
- Jest for testing ✅
- React for UI components ✅
- Three.js for future 3D visualizations ✅

## Achievements Summary
✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Resolved Jest testing environment issues  
✅ Successfully implemented sidereal time calculations
✅ Created comprehensive test suite (11 tests passing)
✅ Built and verified production build works
✅ Ready for next development phase

## Next Steps for Location Service
The next feature to implement is an enhanced Location Service that will include:
1. Improved geolocation integration
2. Coordinate system transformations
3. Enhanced timezone handling
4. Integration with astronomical position calculations
